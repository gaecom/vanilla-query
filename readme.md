# Vanilla Query

A syntax-conversion for Vanilla JS & CSS3 methods using traditional jQuery conventions.

Warning: This is NOT a replacement for jQuery. It is still recommended to use jQuery if your app uses plugins and/or makes extensive use of its methods/selectors.

Then again, if you are only using jQuery to bind events and use simple selectors, for example in a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) app, Vanilla JS already does that :)
